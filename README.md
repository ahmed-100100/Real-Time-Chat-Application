• Objective: Develop a Real-Time Chat Application using React.
◦ Description: Create a real-time chat application where users can join public or private chat rooms, send direct messages, and receive notifications.
  React will be used for rendering chat interfaces, while Node.js and Web Sockets will power real-time message delivery and chatroom management.
  The frontend will feature user authentication, message threads, and typing indicators.
  HTML5 and CSS3 will handle layout and animations for an engaging user experience.
• Technologies to use: React, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API Integration, and Frontend Development.

Week 1: Setup and Initial Features Tasks:
• Project Setup: Set up React and NodeJS environment, install dependencies (WebSockets, etc.).
• Create Chat Interface Wireframes: Design the chat interface including chat rooms and message threads.
• Basic Layout: Implement basic layout using HTML5 and CSS3.
• Socket.IO Setup: Set up WebSocket communication using Socket.IO for real-time messaging.
• Deliverables: Basic chat interface layout.
• Initial WebSocket setup for handling connections.

Week 2: Core Features Implementation Tasks:
• Real-Time Messaging: Develop functionality for sending and receiving messages in real-time using WebSockets.
• Chat Rooms: Implement public and private chat room creation and management.
• User Authentication: Add basic user authentication (e.g., with JWT or OAuth) for securing chatrooms.
• Typing Indicators: Implement typing indicators to show when other users are typing.
• Deliverables: Functional real-time messaging. • Secure chat room management. • User authentication implemented.

Week 3: Additional Features and Testing Tasks:
• Direct Messaging: Implement the feature to allow users to send direct messages (DMs) outside of chat rooms.
• Notification System: Set up notifications for new messages and DMs.
• Testing: Conduct functional tests for real-time messaging, chat rooms, and authentication.
• Error Handling: Implement error handling for WebSocket disconnections and reconnections.
• Deliverables: Working direct messaging and notification system. • Functional and well-tested chat application.

Week 4: Final Enhancements and Deployment Tasks:
• UI Enhancements: Refine the UI/UX with animations, mobile responsiveness, and accessibility improvements.
• Performance Optimization: Optimize WebSocket communication to ensure smooth performance with multiple users.
• Final Testing: Conduct end-to-end testing for the entire chat application.
• Deploy Application: Deploy the chat application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
• Complete Documentation: Document the application features, backend API, and deployment process.
• Deliverables: Deployed real-time chat application. • Finalized project documentation. • Fully optimized and responsive UI with real-time functionality.
